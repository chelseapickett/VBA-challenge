## Module 2 Challenge

#### This project analyzes stock data from multiple years to determine the stocks that have the greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease and greatest total volume from the opening price at the beginning of a year to the closing price at end of that year. This was done by creating a VBA script that will run on each worksheet in the provided workbook. The code written cycles through all the stocks for one year and gives an initial analysis of each ticker's yearly change from opening price at the beginning of the year to closing price at the end of the year, the percent change of each ticker over the same span of time and the total stock volume of each stock. Additional analysis outputs which stock had the greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease and greatest total volume for each year.  

#### The stock_data.png files show the results of the stock analysis for ![2018](https://github.com/chelseapickett/VBA-challenge/blob/main/2018%20stock_data.png), ![2019](https://github.com/chelseapickett/VBA-challenge/blob/main/2019%20stock_data.png), and ![2020](https://github.com/chelseapickett/VBA-challenge/blob/main/2020%20%20stock_data.png), respectively. 
#### The ![Module_2_VBA_script_stock_data.bas](https://github.com/chelseapickett/VBA-challenge/blob/main/Module_2_VBA_script_stock_data.bas) file shows the VBA script written to achieve results.
